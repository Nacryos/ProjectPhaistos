Status: Partial run-based regeneration available.
Measured rows with run deltas: 1
Max absolute delta vs paper: 0.1020

Likely causes for mismatch when run-based values differ:
- Random seed differences and optimization variance.
- Data version differences (Wiktionary descendants and manually curated sources).
- Library/runtime differences from the original 2021 environment.
